I'm a marTech Engineer (kind of data engineer for marketing ops) & am currently learning about Natural Language Processing. 

Mostly I like to write code in Python, but occasionally do some Javascript, HTML, CSS.

Here is some of the stuff I enjoy doing:

- Work with serverless approach 👀
- Put stuff in production 
- I love to work with APIs and blend multiple data sources to bring something new 💞️
- Data viz on powerbi or py
